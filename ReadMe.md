# TypeScript-Library-Template

Two ways to set up solutions in Visual Studio for creating TypeScript-libraries with integration/unit tests.

1. [ASP.NET Core projects](/Source/ASP.NET-Core/)
2. [NodeJS projects](/Source/Node-JS/)

I prefer the using ASP.NET Core projects with separate projects for integration-tests and unit-tests.
